# BJT-Amplifier

Designed and simulated a 3-stage inverting BJT amplifier (CE-CE-CC), meeting all design specifications and earning a perfect project score. Conducted both AC and DC analysis, maintaining a +10V power supply, 10mA quiescent current, and achieving a no-load voltage gain of 50. Additionally, the amplifier achieved a maximum loaded voltage of 4V, ensuring reliable performance under operating constraints. Key benchmarks and manual calculations were thoroughly documented in a detailed design report.
